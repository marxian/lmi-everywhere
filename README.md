LMI Everywhere
============== 
A prototype widget for distributing information from http://api.lmiforall.org.uk

LMI Everywhere is a responsive application designed for easy resuse. Currently it prompts the viewer to imagine their future profession and then fetches and visualises data about the projected job market in an area.

It can either detect the viewers location or be configured to show data relevant to a specific area.

Currently LMI Everywhere is ready (in so far as it is ready at all after 4 and a half hours of work) for deployment on the following platforms:

    * On the web as an embeddable widget
    * As a browser extension
    * As a standalone site
    * IOS (iPhone / iPad / iPod Touch)
    * Android (Tablet and Mobile Phone)
    * Blackberry
    * Windows 8 Mobile

Here's a shot of the Chrome Browser extension version embedding the  widget on www.rightmove.co.uk
